Which Dogecoin wallets do we recommend?

- Software wallet: [Atomic](https://atomicwallet.io/dogecoin-wallet)
- Light wallet: [MultiDoge](https://dogecoin.com/) syncs with the blockchain by "skimming" through the blockchain, providing fast sync times.
- Android wallet: [Bitpay](https://bitpay.com/wallet/), [Dogecoin wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.langerhans.wallet)
- Full node wallet: [Dogecoin Core](https://dogecoin.com/) is a full Dogecoin client and builds the backbone of the network. It offers high levels of security, privacy, and stability. However, it has fewer features and it takes a lot of space and memory.
- Hardware wallets: [Ledger](https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s), [Trezor](https://shop.trezor.io/)
