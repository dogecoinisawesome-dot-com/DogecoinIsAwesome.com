## General

### What is Dogecoin?

Dogecoin is a consensus network that enables a new payment system and a completely digital money. It is a decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen. From a user perspective, Dogecoin is pretty much like cash for the Internet.

### Who created Dogecoin?

Developers Mr. Markus and Jackson Palmer co-created dogecoin as a joke in 2013. Even the way people originally obtained the coin was meant to be ridiculous: In return for solving mathematical puzzles, dogecoin miners operating fast-running computers received anywhere from one dogecoin to hundreds of thousands of dogecoins.

Neither works on the project anymore, and Mr. Markus has said he sold all of his dogecoin in 2015. He made just enough from it to buy a used Honda Civic.

_"The idea of dogecoin being worth 8 cents is the same as GameStop being worth \$325,"_ Mr. Markus, 38 years old, said recently. _"It doesn’t make sense. It’s super absurd. The coin design was absurd."_

### Who controls the Dogecoin network?

Nobody owns the Dogecoin network much like no one owns the technology behind email. Dogecoin is controlled by all Dogecoin users around the world. While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Dogecoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Dogecoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users. Therefore, all users and developers have a strong incentive to protect this consensus.

### How does Dogecoin work?

From a user perspective, Dogecoin is nothing more than a mobile app or computer program that provides a personal Dogecoin wallet and allows a user to send and receive dogecoins with them. This is how Dogecoin works for most users.
Behind the scenes, the Dogecoin network is sharing a public ledger called the "block chain". This ledger contains every transaction ever processed, allowing a user's computer to verify the validity of each transaction. The authenticity of each transaction is protected by digital signatures corresponding to the sending addresses, allowing all users to have full control over sending dogecoins from their own Dogecoin addresses. In addition, anyone can process transactions using the computing power of specialized hardware and earn a reward in dogecoins for this service. This is often called "mining".

### Is Dogecoin really used by people?

Yes. There are a growing number of businesses and individuals using Dogecoin. This includes brick-and-mortar businesses like restaurants, apartments, as well as popular online services. While Dogecoin remains a relatively new phenomenon, it is growing fast.

### How does one acquire dogecoins?

- As payment for goods or services.
- Purchase dogecoins at a Dogecoin exchange.
- Exchange dogecoins with someone near you.
- Earn dogecoins through competitive mining.

While it may be possible to find individuals who wish to sell dogecoins in exchange for a credit card or PayPal payment, most exchanges do not allow funding via these payment methods. This is due to cases where someone buys dogecoins with PayPal, and then reverses their half of the transaction. This is commonly referred to as a chargeback.

### How difficult is it to make a Dogecoin payment?

Dogecoin payments are easier to make than debit or credit card purchases, and can be received without a merchant account. Payments are made from a wallet application, either on your computer or smartphone, by entering the recipient's address, the payment amount, and pressing send. To make it easier to enter a recipient's address, many wallets can obtain the address by scanning a QR code or touching two phones together with NFC technology.

### What are the advantages of Dogecoin?

- Payment freedom - It is possible to send and receive dogecoins anywhere in the world at any time. No bank holidays. No borders. No bureaucracy. Dogecoin allows its users to be in full control of their money.
- Choose your own fees - There is no fee to receive dogecoins, and many wallets let you control how large a fee to pay when spending. Higher fees can encourage faster confirmation of your transactions. Fees are unrelated to the amount transferred, so it's possible to send 100,000 dogecoins for the same fee it costs to send 1 dogecoin. Additionally, merchant processors exist to assist merchants in processing transactions, converting dogecoins to fiat currency and depositing funds directly into merchants' bank accounts daily. As these services are based on Dogecoin, they can be offered for much lower fees than with PayPal or credit card networks.
- Fewer risks for merchants - Dogecoin transactions are secure, irreversible, and do not contain customers’ sensitive or personal information. This protects merchants from losses caused by fraud or fraudulent chargebacks, and there is no need for PCI compliance. Merchants can easily expand to new markets where either credit cards are not available or fraud rates are unacceptably high. The net results are lower fees, larger markets, and fewer administrative costs.
- Security and control - Dogecoin users are in full control of their transactions; it is impossible for merchants to force unwanted or unnoticed charges as can happen with other payment methods. Dogecoin payments can be made without personal information tied to the transaction. This offers strong protection against identity theft. Dogecoin users can also protect their money with backup and encryption.
- Transparent and neutral - All information concerning the Dogecoin money supply itself is readily available on the block chain for anybody to verify and use in real-time. No individual or organization can control or manipulate the Dogecoin protocol because it is cryptographically secure. This allows the core of Dogecoin to be trusted for being completely neutral, transparent and predictable.

### What are the disadvantages of Dogecoin?

- Degree of acceptance - Many people are still unaware of Dogecoin. Every day, more businesses accept dogecoins because they want the advantages of doing so, but the list remains small and still needs to grow in order to benefit from network effects.
- Volatility - The total value of dogecoins in circulation and the number of businesses using Dogecoin are still very small compared to what they could be. Therefore, relatively small events, trades, or business activities can significantly affect the price. In theory, this volatility will decrease as Dogecoin markets and the technology matures.
- Ongoing development - Dogecoin software is still in beta with many incomplete features in active development. New tools, features, and services are being developed to make Dogecoin more secure and accessible to the masses. Some of these are still not ready for everyone. Most Dogecoin businesses are new and still offer no insurance. In general, Dogecoin is still in the process of maturing.

### Why do people trust Dogecoin?

Much of the trust in Dogecoin comes from the fact that it requires no trust at all. Dogecoin is fully open-source and decentralized. This means that anyone has access to the entire source code at any time. Any developer in the world can therefore verify exactly how Dogecoin works. All transactions and dogecoins issued into existence can be transparently consulted in real-time by anyone. All payments can be made without reliance on a third party and the whole system is protected by heavily peer-reviewed cryptographic algorithms like those used for online banking. No organization or individual can control Dogecoin, and the network remains secure even if not all of its users can be trusted.
