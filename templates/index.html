            <h1>Why is Dogecoin Awesome?</h1>
            <p>
                Dogecoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing
                transactions and the issuing of Dogecoins is carried out collectively by the network. Dogecoin is
                open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Dogecoin and everyone can take part.
            </p>
            <h2>A Little History <sup>1</sup></h2>
            <p>
                The first few weeks after Dogecoin was released were incredible, it went from a being a silly joke to
                something worth something to people and a community was developing fast, with lots of people putting up
                services and infrastructure around it.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of those things was an online wallet - instead of having to download the clunky and slow main client
                someone had provided a service to hold people's Dogecoin for them. Online wallets have a history of
                being sketchy, and sure enough, on Christmas, the wallet was hacked, and 21 million Dogecoins were
                stolen in the process.
            </p>
            <p>
                This type of story was all too common in the cryptocurrency world, but what happened next was not. Some
                members of the community got together and started a Dogecoin fund to "Save Dogemas" - to try to return
                money to those who had lost it. The Dogecoin community donated millions of coins to help those who had
                been victims of the bad actor - and that spirit didn't stop, the community would donate Dogecoins for
                both good causes, such as helping build water wells in Africa, helping connect service dogs and kids,
                and silly and amusing causes, such as helping send the Jamaican Bobsled team to the Olympics, or
                sponsoring a Nascar driver.

            <h2>Whatâ€™s the True Value of Dogecoin? <sup>1</sup></h2>
            <p>
                Joy, kindness, learning, giving, empathy, fun, community, inspiration, creativity, generosity,
                silliness, absurdity. These are the things that make Dogecoin what it is and when the community embodies
                these things, that's True Value.
            </p>
